A 3D anime charecter UnityChan is very popular as a fighter girl in Unity Asset Store.Various actions and movement have been implemented in this charecter using C# programming language.It is developed in Unity Game Engine.

Various actions can be controled by pressing 1,2,3,4 keys.

As well as by pressing "SpaceBar" she will jump.

She can notonly walk in the four directions using forward, backward ,left and right buttons but also run and slid in some intervals in the same way along with Left Shift key.

If one gives punches on her by double clicking the mouse she will fall down and again stand up with her own fashion.
